# Communication styles

People often make prescriptive statements disguised as descriptive ones. This suggestive style is used to say judgmental things about other people while leaving space for denying it later, or not exposing themselves too much to the consequences.

The catalyst to convert a descriptive statement into a prescriptive one is the social context: where, when, and to whom we say it. Competitive and judgmental people tend to rely on such a suggestive communication style.

On the other hand, cooperative people tend to make descriptive statements as a means to lay a common ground that invites others to work together, or to experience a personal impression in a social context.
