# The AfD voters vs the Marxists

September of 2024, the AfD has won and every person to the left of it is wondering how is this possible. Mainstream media reflects that shock: journalists in Deutsche Welle qualify the outcome as East Germans' backwardness, suggesting they still struggle to grasp democracy and progressive concepts such as environmentalism and inclusivity.

However, I find this diagnosis rather patronizing for the following reason: the East Germans are actually advanced in an aspect that their western counterparts are not, which is resisting Marxism. Their reaction of voting for the AfD might be even worse than Marxism, but they certainly know how to resist.

Marxist theories share a common thread: they view social interactions through the lens of conflict, often framing society as a struggle between oppressors and the oppressed. They have the appeal of pointing out those places where tradition is harmful to human flourishing, and also give people words, concepts, and strength to fight against such injustices.

However, Marx's ideas have the problem of not explaining win-win situations that follow rules considered an integral part of a capitalist system, such as property rights; they also have internal inconsistencies identified by Karl Popper.

Marx's ideas, like any other philosophical theory, need to be adapted when moving from academic discussion to practical application. This adaptation is overlooked by activists who follow them instead with the zealotry of historical Christian practices, such as destruction of pagan symbols and self-flagellation. Examples include climate protesters spraying orange paint on Stonehenge and the Brandenburg Gate, and gluing themselves to streets and airport runways.

When the practical aspects of applying Marxist theories to society have been considered, rather than following ethical guidelines, proponents seem to double down on zealotry. The Bolsheviks, for instance, created possibly the most repressive state humanity has ever known.

A consequence of the internal deficiencies and practical shortcomings related to Marxist theories is that they are addressed by activists by bullying their critics into submission. When someone critiques _inclusive language_ they will make an ad hominem attack, ignoring the actual argument and speculating about hidden motives like sexism. Another common tactic combines ad hominem fallacies with shifting the burden of proof: when you want a more convincing explanation of some far-from-obvious statement, they say you should shut up because you haven't read books X, Y, and Z. Thus, instead of providing solid evidence for their claim, they pretend it's enough to suggest you're wrong and unworthy due to a lack of academic pedigree.

Another bullying tactic is the framing of an issue in a false dichotomy. If you criticize the idea of gender as something totally independent from biological sex and only determined by personal choice, then they will accuse you of being transphobic, while actually meaning transhater. If you say Jeff Bezos is a brilliant entrepreneur, they will say you're endorsing the exploitation of workers, without considering for half a second that Bezos can be both things: an exploiter and a brilliant entrepreneur; and that maybe there's something we can learn from him. This is the mindset of only confrontation and no win-win situations that Marxist theories instill in people.

This constant bullying is happening today in every Western country, but unlike other Western countries Germany has a significant population raised in the East. They already experienced similar harassment, but instead of just activists there was a state with far-reaching powers to blackmail and punish people by any means possible. For instance, if someone criticized the communist government's economic policy as unreasonable, they would be ostracized by their coworkers, family members and neighbors, and labeled as supporters of working-class exploitation and American imperialism. Such actions also added to their Stasi files. Like today, there was no chance for nuance and for exploring win-win scenarios were the U.S. could be an ally and capitalism could benefit the working class.

A very curious aspect of the implementation of Marxist theories by repressive rather than ethical social engineering is that truth often becomes secondary and obedience the main priority. You might find yourself defending the wrong position, and because of that, you lose every other right you have as a person, or at least you become a second-class citizen. Consider this scenario: you make a comment expressing skepticism towards gender quotas in a private conversation. An colleague then feels justified in reporting you to your employer, potentially resulting in your termination. That is happening today in Berlin, as it did many times before in this same city and the whole of East Germany.

The German police generally avoid mentioning the ethnicity or national origin of criminals in their press reports. This practice stems from historical reasons, but implies the only relevance of such information is what racists and Nazis might do with it. Even if some people arrive at the wrong conclusion, now the whole society has lost the chance of being wrong. Stupidity has been forbidden, but only a very particular one.

People do not have the right to be racists or Nazis, but they just cannot stop being what they are overnight and by decree. This excessive control over individual and subjective experiences reveals flaws in the system we live in.

While some truths and some stupidities were banned by the regulators, after the terrorist attack in Solingen, the government had to recognize that indeed we have a problem with radical Islam and illegal immigration, and act accordingly. It seems, after all, that the hidden numbers were useful for more people than just the racists.

Gender and racial quotas, obedience and piousness as substitutes for truth, bullying of dissidents, denouncing colleagues at work for ideological sins in private conversations, mandatory meetings to lecture every person in the company about inclusion and diversity; all of that came with the Trojan horse of progressiveness, but was never collectively wanted or accepted in unified Germany. This could be one of the catalysts of polarization no one is talking about, because academia and mainstream media have already been infiltrated by these activists. None of them has an incentive to lose their hard-earned social capital. Nevertheless, the East Germans already protested and took down a government that told them day and night they would burn in hell for opposing communism. They might be wondering what the difference is now.
